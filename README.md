# The_Hunters_Lion_King_Project
Final project for Media and Technology 

For our Arduino project, we have chosen to present a scene from the famous movie, The Lion King.
In The Lion King, Scar uses Simba as a bait to drag in and kill Mufasa in a herd of wildebeests.
Players can interact with Scar, Simba, and Mufasa to see dialogue and action.
Five arduinos will be used for this project, each with a unique interaction.
